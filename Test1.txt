aaaaa this is so anyoing to do!!!




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?:


It makes sense instead of guessing what is going on.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?:

Because normal text editors don't have more than one file wile code have lost of different files to do different things


GiT is BADDDD
